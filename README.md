# Hotel Booking API - Node.js with MongoDB Setup README

This README provides instructions for setting up and running a Node.js application with MongoDB. Make sure to follow these steps to successfully get the application up and running on your local environment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Version 14)
- MongoDB

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Git Repository
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Install Dependencies
   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command to install the required npm packages.
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Rename Configuration File
   Locate the `.env.sample` file in the root directory of the project and rename it to `.env`.

4. Configure Environment Variables
   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and set the required environment variables such as database connection URLs, API keys, or any other configuration specific to your application.

5. Start the Application
   Once the environment variables are configured, run the following command to start the Node.js application.
   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the Application
   After successfully starting the application, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to the appropriate URL (usually `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` by default).

## Additional Information

- Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine or provide the appropriate connection URL in the `.env` file to connect to a remote MongoDB server.

- If you encounter any issues during installation or setup, refer to the project's documentation or seek help from the project maintainers.

- This README assumes that you are familiar with basic Git commands, Node.js, and npm package manager.

- For production deployments, make sure to follow best practices for security and environment configuration.

- Remember to keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control, as it may contain sensitive information.

Enjoy working with your Node.js application and MongoDB!
